/**
 This class illustrates how to make a custom class conform to the `NSSecureCoding` protocol so you can serialize/deserialize it. It also shows how to handle Swift optionals, which may or may not have a value.
 
 All that's necessary is to implement the `init?(coder:)` and `encode(with:)` functions. 
 
 In `encode(with aCoder: NSCoder)` you add key/value pairs to the NSCoder representing your object's state.
 
 Likewise in `init?(coder:)` you extract values for your object's properties from the provided `NSCoder` object.
 
 For new development it's recommended that you conform to `NSSecureCoding` rather than `NSCoding`, since this provides type safety in the objects that are encoded.
 
 If you object uses other custom objects as properties you just need to make sure that those objects also conform to `NSSecureCoding`.
 
 Once your object conforms to `NSSecureCoding` (or `NSCoding`) you can use methods like `NSKeyedArchiver.archivedData(withRootObject)` to convert your object to NSData, or `NSKeyedArchiver.archiveRootObject(_ rootObject:toFile:)`, which will archive the object directly to a file. */

   This is the init method you need to implement in order to conform to `NSCoding` or `NSSecureCoding`. For NSSecureCoding, you need to use the method `decodeObject(of:forkey:)`, which verifies that the objects you are decoding are the correct type. This prevents accidental or malicious mistyping of objects.
